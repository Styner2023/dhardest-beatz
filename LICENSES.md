## Summary

| | |
|---|---|
| **Retail value of the stack, year one** | **$412** |
| **Actual recurring cost** | **$213 / year** |

## What costs money

| Component | Licence | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Envato Elements subscription (template source) | Subscription | $198/yr ($16.50/mo annual; $33/mo monthly) |
| Domain — dhardestbeatz.com | Annual registration | ~$15/yr |
| Vercel hosting | Hobby (free tier) | $0 — Pro is $20/mo if ever needed |

**Total recurring: $213/year.**

### Envato Elements — action required

Elements licences attach to a **registered project**, not to an account. The template must be
registered to this site in the Elements dashboard **while the subscription is active**. Once
registered, the licence is permanent and survives cancelling the subscription. Any stock
photography sourced from Elements needs the same registration.

Standalone alternative: the *Agenci* template sells on ThemeForest for **$12 one-time**
(regular licence) — cheaper than the subscription if Elements isn't used for other work.

## What it would have cost

| Component | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| GSAP Club — Business tier (required for paid client work) | $199/yr | **$0** |
| GSAP Club — Premium tier (same plugins, solo developer) | $149/yr | **$0** |
| GSAP Club — Plus tier (entry) | $99/yr | **$0** |

This site uses **ScrollSmoother** and **SplitText** — the smooth scrolling and the split-letter
headline reveals. Both were Club GreenSock paid-only plugins until **April 2025**, when Webflow
(which acquired GreenSock in October 2024) released the entire library free for commercial use.

**Known issue:** the bundled GSAP files are **version 3.11.4 (2022)** and still carry the old
restrictive header text — *"only authorized for use ... with an active Club GreenSock membership."*
The plugins are free now, but this copy's licence text predates the change. Upgrading to
**GSAP 3.13+** (free) replaces those headers with the current no-charge licence. Recommended.

## Free forever

All MIT unless noted. MIT permits commercial use, modification, and distribution; the only
obligation is retaining the copyright headers — which is why those headers remain in the
vendor files and must not be stripped.

### Fonts

Both typefaces are by **Rajesh Rajput**, released free for personal and commercial use
(pay-what-you-want). Verified against the metadata embedded in the font files.

| Font | Files | Licence | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Thunder | `Thunder-{Bold,SemiBold,Medium,}LC.ttf` | Free / PWYW | $0 |
| Mango Grotesque | `mango-grotesque.ttf` | Free / PWYW | $0 |

> Note: a different, unrelated **Thunder** by Pangram Pangram is a paid commercial typeface.
> This project does **not** use it. Don't substitute font files without re-checking the foundry.
